# Ketron EVM-Button-Controller Enclosure

More details and refinement of the OpenScad 3D design and code to follow.

The controller enclosure consists of three components:
- Bottom case
  - The PCB and next two layers insert into the bottom case. This case has openings for the UCB connection as well as the Macropad reset.
- Top cover
  - Keys are inserted into the PCB using the top cover as guide. The top cover also hides the encoder shaft.
- Filler layer
  - This later is inserted in between the top cover layaer and the MacroPad PCB. This ensure that the top cover cannot be pressed onto the PCB.

Assembly Instructions: To do.
